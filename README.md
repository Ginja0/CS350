Emerging Technologies

This project is an embedded project that simulates a thermostat. This is using a TI SimpleLink CC3220S.
What I did well was work the problem out properly.
I could have improved on commenting a bit more. 
The skills learned in this project I can use in others is problem solving. There was a lot of problem solving in this project and real-world application. 
Tools that I learned when working with this is working with embedded technologies and a basic understanding of different functions that are used.
I tried to make the code simple to understand.
